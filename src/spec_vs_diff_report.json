  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive backend connection error handling, health checks, and error recovery mechanisms. All five requirements appear to be addressed with extensive logging, user-friendly error messages, retry functionality, and a new admin session management system. The implementation includes a ping() health check method, error classification utilities, and careful state management for actor readiness.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on fixing backend connection errors and eliminating runtime errors. The addition of an admin session token system (useAdminSession, adminSession.ts, AdminAccessRecovery component) appears to be a new authentication/authorization feature not requested in the requirements.",
